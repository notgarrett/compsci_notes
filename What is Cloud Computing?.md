# Definitions

**Cloud Computing: **

"a style of computing in which *scaleable and elastic* IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to external customers using *internet technologies*" - Gartner

"a standardised IT capability (services, software, or infrastructure) delivered via *Internet* technologies in a *pay per use*, self-service way" - Forrester Research 

"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., *networks, servers, storage, applications, and services*) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” – National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Note that there are multiple definitions of **Cloud Computing**. 

# Drivers for Cloud Computing
## Business
**Primary Business Drivers:**
- Capacity Planning
- Cost Reduction
- Organisational Agility

### Capacity Planning
**Definition**: The process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an *organisation's IT resources, products, and services*. Capacity represents the max amount of work an IT resource is capable of delivering in a given period of time.

**Goal**: Minimise discrepancy between demand and capacity. 

**Alternate Strategies**: 
- Lead Strategy - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand (with demand forecast)
- Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
- Match Strategy - adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases. (incremental.)

### Cost Reduction
A *direct alignment* between *IT costs and business performance* can be difficult to maintain. 

Thus two costs need to be accounted for:
1. The cost of acquiring new infrastructure
2. The cost of its ongoing ownership

**Operational overhead** represents a considerable share of IT budgets, often exceeding up-front investment costs.

Common forms of infrastructure-related operating overhead:
- Technical personnel required to keep the environment operational.
- Upgrades and patches that introduce additional testing and deployment cycles.
- Investments for power and cooling. 
- Security and access control measures that need to be maintained and enforced to protect infrastructure resources.

### Organisational Agility
**Definition**: The measure of an organisation's responsiveness to change.

An IT enterprise often needs to respond to business change by *scaling its IT resources* beyond the scope of what was previously planned/predicted for.

# Cloud Tech Innovations

## Clustering 
A cluster is a group of independent IT resources that are interconnected and work as a single system. 
- Redundancy and fail over features are inherent to the cluster.
- Component systems have reasonably identical hardware and operating systems.
- Component devices are kept in synchronisation through high-speed communication links.

**Impact**: Built-in redundancy and fail over are core to cloud platforms. 

## Grid Computing

**Definition**: A computing grid (or "computational grid") provides a platform in which computing resources are organised into one or more logical **pools.**

```ad-note
title: Pools vs Clusters
Pools are collectively coordinated to provide high performance. Similiar to clusters, however they difer in that the grid systems are much more loosely coupled and distributed. They aren't as reliant on each other.
```

Grid computing is based on a **middle ware** layer that is deployed on computing resources.

**Impact:** Networked access, resource pooling, and scalability and resiliency; cloud computing as a descendant of grid computing.

## Virtualisation

**Definition:** A technology platform used for the creation of virtual instances of **IT resources**

# Cloud Concepts

## Cloud Characteristics

The cloud platform offers scaleable computing paradigm built around the data centres.

Cloud resources are dynamically provisioned by data centres upon user demand.

The cloud system provides compute, storage, and flexible platforms for upgraded web services.

Cloud computing relies heavily on the virtualisation of all kinds of resources. 

Cloud computing defines a new paradigm for collective computing, data consumption, and delivery of information services over the internet.

Cloud stress the cost of ownership reduction in mega centres.


## Technologies

Ubiquity of broadband and wireless networking
- Falling storage costs
- Progressive improvements in internet computing software

Convergence of Technologies
- Hardware Virtualisation, Multi-core Chips and Multi-threaded Processors and hardware Accelerators
- Utility and grid computing
- Service oriented architecture, Web 2.0
- Automatic Computing and automated data centre

I recommend looking into different cloud computing diagrams.
