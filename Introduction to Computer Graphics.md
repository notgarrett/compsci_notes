# Definition of Computer Graphics

**Computer graphics** refers to a technology that generates images on a computer screen. As you seek to understand it better, it can be helpful to think of computer graphics as the intersection of design and computer science.

Computer graphics is concerned with the generation, representation, manipulation, and display of pictures with the aid of a computer.

# Types of Computer Graphics

**Raster Graphics**:
- Computer graphics refers to a technology that generates images on a computer screen. As you seek to understand it better, it can be helpful to think of computer graphics as the intersection of design and computer science.

**Vector Graphics:**
- A vector graphic consists of shapes and lines that use mathematical formulas to determine how they relate to each other. These formulas enable you to scale vector graphics larger or smaller without distorting the shape or resolution.
- CGI, or computer-generated imagery, takes 2D vector graphics and transforms them into 3D representations and raster images. TV, film, and video games use this technology to depict characters, scenes, and special effects.

**Interactive Computer Graphics:**
- Interactive computer graphics allow you to tell a computer how to generate an image. The following offers a sampling of what you can do in interactive computer graphics:
	- Add automatic zooming on an interactive scrolling interface to improve the scan of a 2D information space.
	- Add automatic adjustments to digital sketch programs to easily record ideas in 2D using digital ink.
	- Add a dragging feature to clothing animations to improve the experience of adding clothes to 3D characters.
	- Add a dragging feature to clothing animations to improve the experience of adding clothes to 3D characters.
	- Design indoor lighting using a painting interface to control a robotic lighting system.

**Non-interactive Computer Graphics:**
- In contrast to interactive computer graphics, non-interactive computer graphics do not allow you to determine how the computer generates images. Examples of non-interactive computer graphics include images for a website or mobile application, 3D animation, and CGI in film.

# Cognitive Graphics

Deals with algorithms to recognise and classify pictures.

Think applications like:
- Image classification AI.
- Microscope pictures of bacterial colonies.
	- I assume it means using the algorithms to sharpen or get more detail out of the image.

# Image Processing Graphics

Image processing apply techniques to modify or interpret existing pictures, such as photographs and TV scans.

Used to improve and modify the quality of a picture(s). 

First image is digitised and there it is given a colour pattern for improving colour quality.

Image processing has sub sections like image enhancement, pattern detection and recognition, and scene analysis and computer vision.
