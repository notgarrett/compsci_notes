The protector is about to drop lore.

"When the three of you arrived, blind child you were carrying grub child in your head wrapped in this... uh... we think it's a baby blanket". (The blanket is a cocoon, my character is disgusting). 

Letter for Amber (Blind Child): "You were clutching this in your hand, written in Aclo, no one knows how to read it." Amber's letter is still unreadable, despite her understanding the language.

Letter for Caroline (Scaly Child): "We have no idea if you are from the capital or from that region but this letter briefly describes how sorry your parents are for abandoning you but was done out of necessity." 

LORE DROP: HOODED MAN WAS WITH US, I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
