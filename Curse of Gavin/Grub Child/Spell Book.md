**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature  
**Saving Throw** Fortitude; **Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

---

You evoke buzzing and crawling insects to climb onto a foe's body and bite, dealing 1d4 piercing damage and potentially sickening the foe, depending on its Fortitude save. You deal the piercing damage initially and then again the first time each round you Sustain the Spell, starting on the round after you cast it and rolling the damage based on the target's saving throw result each time. However, the creature only attempts the Fortitude save once, when you first Cast the Spell. Once this spell ends, the target becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.  
  
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is sickened 1 by the crawling insects. The sickened value can't be reduced below 1 while the spell is active.

---

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.

---

At your unspoken plea, your patron temporarily assumes control over your familiar. You Command your familiar, allowing it to take its normal actions this turn. Your Command does not have the [auditory](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=16) or [concentrate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=683) traits; your patron simply moves its agent directly.

# First Level Spells

### Witch: (3)

Grease
- **Duration** 1 minute
- **Range** 30 feet; **Area** 4 contiguous 5-foot squares or; **Targets** 1 object of 1 Bulk or less
- You conjure grease, choosing an area or target.
- **Area** All solid ground in the area is covered with grease. Each creature standing on the greasy surface must succeed at a Reflex save or an [Acrobatics](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=1) check against your spell DC or fall [prone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=31). Creatures using an action to move onto the greasy surface during the spell's duration must attempt either a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check to [Balance](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=28). A creature that Steps or [Crawls](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=76) doesn't have to attempt a check or save.
- **Target** If you Cast the Spell on an unattended object, anyone trying to pick up the object must succeed at an Acrobatics check or Reflex save against your spell DC to do so. If you target an attended object, the creature that has the object must attempt an Acrobatics check or Reflex save. On a failure, the holder or wielder takes a –2 circumstance penalty to all checks that involve using the object; on a critical failure, the holder or wielder releases the item. The object lands in an adjacent square of the GM's choice. If you Cast this Spell on a worn object, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against attempts to grapple them.

### Witch: (3)

Breath of Drought
- **Duration** sustained
- **Range** 30 feet; **Area** 10-foot burst
- You fill the area with an oppressive, arid swelter that overwhelms creatures with heat exhaustion. Objects are unaffected. Each creature in the area when the spell is cast or that ends its turn in the area afterward must attempt a Fortitude save.

- **Critical Failure** The creature is sickened 2.

- **Saving Throw** [basic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=2765) Reflex; **Defense** [basic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=2765) Reflex
- You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn't change the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone in the area, their bites and stings dealing 2d8 piercing damage ([basic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes sickened 1. Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.

---

You sift through myriad potential futures, seize upon one potential moment in which the target meets a particularly gruesome and fatal end, and then show it a vision of its impending demise. The intense mental vision grows more and more terrifying to the target as the doom grows closer, and it takes 3 rounds to reach its conclusion.

**Duration** 1 minute

---

You surround yourself in a vortex of whirling colorful scarves of force that obfuscate you and disorient your foes. You gain the benefits of the [concealed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) condition, but only against ranged and melee attacks. When a melee attack fails to hit you because of the flat check for the concealed condition, the scarves snag the weapon or unarmed attack, and the creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to further attacks with that weapon or unarmed attack until the end of its turn (or the end of its next turn, if it wasn’t the creature’s turn). The timing of the scarves’ movement is harder to predict for ranged attackers, so the flat check for the concealed condition against ranged attacks increases from DC 5 to DC 6. You can Dismiss this spell.

---

**Heightened (+2)** The circumstance penalty to further attacks with a melee weapon or unarmed attack the scarves snag increases by 1. The DC of the flat check for the concealed condition against ranged attacks increases by 1.
