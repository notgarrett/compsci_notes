**Witch Class Feats:** 

Cackle
- Your patron’s power fills you with confidence, letting you sustain a magical working even as a quick burst of laughter leaves your lips. You learn the [_cackle_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1875) hex.

Basic Lesson (Lesson of Vengeance)
- Needle of Vengeance Hex
	- 1 minutes
	- A long, jagged needle jabs into the target foe's psyche whenever it tries to attack a creature your patron holds in special regard. Name yourself or one of your allies. The target takes 2 mental damage any time it uses a [hostile action](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=300) against the named creature, with a basic Will save.
- Phantom Pain
	- Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage and 1d4 [persistent mental damage](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) with a Will save.
		- **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
		- **Success** The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately.  
		- **Failure** The target takes full initial and persistent damage, and the target is [sickened 1](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=34). If the target recovers from being sickened, the persistent damage ends and the spell ends.  
		- **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is sickened 2.

**Oracle Class Feats:** 
Domain Acumen (Vigil)
- Every oracle's mystery touches on a divine domain of the deities that fuel it; you can access that power. Choose one of the domains associated with your mystery for which you don't already have an initial domain spell. You gain an initial domain spell from that domain, which you cast as a revelation spell.
- Object Memory:
	- By touching an object, you draw forth the experience of those who created and used it. If you touch a weapon, your proficiency rank with that weapon temporarily increases to trained (if it is not already higher). If you touch a tool, your proficiency rank with the next skill check you attempt with that tool (such as a [Crafting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4) check with a blacksmith’s hammer) within the spell’s duration temporarily increases to trained (if it is not already higher). This spell has no benefit for activities that take longer than a minute to complete.
	- 1 minute.
	- Targets 1 minute.

Thousand Visions
- You open your senses to numerous visions of the immediate future. The visions grant you subtle details of your immediate surroundings within 30 feet. Within this range, you don't need to succeed at a flat check to target a concealed creature, you're not [off-guard](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=58) to creatures that are [hidden](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=79) from you (unless you're off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature. Beyond 30 feet, the visions become overwhelmed with too many possible futures, making all of your senses imprecise beyond this range. The visions persist for 1 minute.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Advanced Revelation
- Divine power reveals greater mysteries to you. You learn the advanced revelation spell associated with your mystery.
- Bone Armor
	- You ossify your physical form, mimicking the durability of bone. You gain resistance 3 to cold, electricity, fire, piercing, and slashing damage.
	- 1 minute.
	- **Heightened (+1)** The resistance increases by 1.

Read Disaster
- You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the [divine](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=579) mysteries of the world, peering into the most sinister portents of the future. You gain the effects of [_augury_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1445), except you learn only about the dangers ahead; any results of “good” are instead “nothing,” and results of “mixed” are instead “bad.” If you are legendary in [Religion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=46), you take only 1 minute to [Read Disaster](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1496).


[[https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/feats/roll-the-bones-of-fate-rm |Roll the bones of fate]]
- Once per 10 minutes.
- You roll a handful of bones to learn (or perhaps influence) the future course of events. Roll 1d4 and use the corresponding result below. Whenever you Roll the Bones of Fate, any effects from a previous usage immediately end.  
- **1 Good** You or an ally within 30 feet can roll twice on your next attack roll or skill check, taking the higher result. This is a [fortune](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=612) effect.  
- **2 Bad** One creature you are observing within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save against your spellcasting DC; on a failure, the target must roll twice on their next attack roll or skill check that takes at least one action to perform, taking the lower result. This is a [misfortune](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=654) effect.  
- **3 Mixed** You gain the benefits of rolling both a 1 and a 2.  
- **4 Cursed Possibilities** Your attempts to meddle in the forces of prophecy bring dire consequences for all. Every creature within 30 feet of you when you perform the augury rolls twice on their next attack roll or skill check that takes at least one action to perform; if the highest number rolled is odd, they take the lower result, and if the highest number rolled is even, they take the higher result. If they took the lower result, this effect has the misfortune trait for them, and if they took the higher result, it has the fortune trait.

Domain Fluency (Vigil)
- Remember the lost
	- You call upon the lost and forgotten, assailing your foes’ minds with the memories of those who died with a grievance toward them. Enemies in the area take 6d6 mental damage (basic Will save) and are [frightened 1](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) on a critical failure. If you know the names of anyone murdered or grievously wronged by an enemy in the area, you can chant those victims’ names when you cast the spell to improve the clarity of the visions, increasing the damage to the corresponding enemy from 6d6 to 6d10; you can do so for multiple enemies if you know victims of each enemy. The visions are personal to each foe in the area, and you can’t use this spell to discern a murderer by guessing a name. A creature that truly knows no one who died with any sort of grievance to that creature is immune to this effect.
	- 30 foot radius around me.
	- Basic will save.
	- **Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6 (or 2d10 to an enemy when you name a specific victim).

Revelations Focus
- The further extents of your mystery provide an endless wellspring of magic. When you [Refocus](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=2621), you regain all your Focus Points instead of 1.

Forestall Curse
- You've learned to hold back your [curse](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=566). If the next action you use is a [cursebound](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=800) ability, your cursebound value doesn't increase.

[[https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=6085|Divine Effusion]]
- The power of your mystery surges through you like a font of [divine](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=579) energy, even when your own magic dwindles. Twice per day, you can cast a spell after you've run out of spell slots of the appropriate spell rank; the two spells you cast with this feat must be of different spell ranks.

[[https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=6086|Mystery Conduit]] 
- The power of your mystery enables you access to myriad magic. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=2734) of 5th rank or lower that has no duration, you do not expend a spell slot.
