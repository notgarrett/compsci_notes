Use to be the king

Old King may not be dead. 
Who knows? 

Terrible plague that spread across the lovers province. A terrible plague that causes the host to enter whimsy, lesions appear that makes a plasma like substance that turns into golden branches. In legend, if left untreated, the protrusions would grow roots into the ground and turn you into a cursed tree. Victims do not die, they are known to be in constant immense pain. The curse is called the flaxxing glee. Old king could take on other people's illnesses, and had a great fortitude to resist said illness. To save his people he took on everyone's curse and sealed himself in the old capital. Many go to the ruins and none return.

Current Emperor: His Son, Uldric
