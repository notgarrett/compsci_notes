# Scaling

## Horizontal vs Vertical

### Horizontal
- **Allocating or releasing** of IT resources that are of the same type 
- Adding or subtracting more devices

### Vertical
- The **replacing** of an IT resource with another that has a *higher capacity*
- Basically you are upgrading machines as opposed to adding or removing machines.

### Comparisons

| Horizontal Scaling                         | Vertical Scaling                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Less expensive                             | More expensive                            |
| IT resources instantly available           | IT resources normally instantly available |
| Resource replication and automated scaling | Additional setup is commonly required     |
| Not limited by hardware capacity           | Limited by maximum hardware capacity      |
| Additional IT resources needed             | No additional IT resources needed         |
