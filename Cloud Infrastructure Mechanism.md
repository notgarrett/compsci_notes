# Logical Network Perimeter

It can be defined as the **isolation of a network** from the **rest of the communications network** environment.

It establishes a **virtual network boundary** to keep a group of related cloud-based **physically distributed** IT resources, encompassed and isolated.

This mechanism can be implemented to:
- Isolate IT resources in a cloud from non-authorised users.
- Isolate IT resources in a cloud from non-users.
- Isolate IT resources in a cloud from cloud consumers.
- Control the bandwidth that is available to isolate IT resources.

# Virtual Firewall and Virtual Network

**Virtual Firewall:** An IT resource that **actively filters network traffic** to and from the isolated network while controlling its interactions with the internet.

**Virtual Network:** Usually **acquired through VLANS** - it isolates the network environment within the data centre infrastructure.

Cloud infrastructure mechanisms are foundational building blocks of cloud environments that establish **primary artefacts** to form the basis of fundamental cloud technology architecture.

# Scenario: Two Logical Network

The figure below depicts a scenario in which one logical network perimeter contains a cloud consumer;s **on premise environment** while another contains a cloud provider's **cloud based environment**. 

There perimeters are connected through a VPN that protects communications during their transit, since the **VPN is typically implemented by point-to-point encryption** of the data packets sent between the communicating endpoints.

# Virtual Server

A **virtual server** is a form of virtualisation software that emulates a physical server.

As a commodity mechanism, the Virtual Server represents the most foundational building block of cloud environments. 

Each virtual server can host numerous IT resources, cloud-based solutions, and various other cloud computing mechanisms.

Cloud consumers that install or lease virtual servers can customise these environments independently from other cloud consumers that may be using virtual servers hosted by the same underlying physical server.

# Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM)

The virtual infrastructure manager (VIM) is an **infrastructure component**.
