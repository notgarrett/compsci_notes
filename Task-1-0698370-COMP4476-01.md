KX is a common reoccuring two character combination.

K = T
X = H

DIZ and KXZ are common 3 letter combinations.
Assuming:

K = T
X = H
Z = E

thQU JBBM RBFtDQFU D GQIUt SeDI YIDOVDte RBVIUe QF ChQRh the JDUQR teRhFQTVeU DFO theBIeNU BG DFDASUQU DIe HIeUeFteO QF UVRh D CDS thDt the QFtQNDte RBFFeRtQBFU JetCeeF QtU LDIQBVU JIDFRheU DIe UtIBFYAS eNHhDUQPeO the tIDOQtQBFDAeS UeHDIDte UVJWeRtU BG IeDA DFDASUQU DFO RBNHAeE DFDASUQU DIe thVU VFQteO UBNe BG the JDUQR QOeDU GIBN GVFRtQBFDA DFDASUQU DIe DAUB QFRAVOeO

thDt is likly "that".

Assuming:
D = a

aIe may be are.

Assuming:
I = r

thQU JBBM RBFtaQFU a GQrUt Sear YraOVate RBVrUe QF ChQRh the JaUQR teRhFQTVeU aFO theBreNU BG aFaASUQU are HreUeFteO QF UVRh a CaS that the QFtQNate RBFFeRtQBFU JetCeeF QtU LarQBVU JraFRheU are UtrBFYAS eNHhaUQPeO the traOQtQBFaAeS UeHarate UVJWeRtU BG reaA aFaASUQU aFO RBNHAeE aFaASUQU are thVU VFQteO UBNe BG the JaUQR QOeaU GrBN GVFRtQBFaA aFaASUQU are aAUB QFRAVOeO

QF and BG are two letter pairs we have.

Assuming QF is IN
Q = i
F = n

thiU JBBM RBftaifU a GirUt Sear YraOVate RBVrUe if ChiRh the JaUiR teRhfiTVeU afO theBreNU BG afaASUiU are HreUefteO if UVRh a CaS that the iftiNate RBffeRtiBfU JetCeef itU LariBVU JrafRheU are UtrBfYAS eNHhaUiPeO the traOitiBfaAeS UeHarate UVJWeRtU BG reaA afaASUiU afO RBNHAeE afaASUiU are thVU VfiteO UBNe BG the JaUiR iOeaU GrBN GVfRtiBfaA afaASUiU are aAUB ifRAVOeO

This looks promising.
I am going to assume the first word is this.

U = s

this JBBM RBftaifs a Girst Sear YraOVate RBVrse if ChiRh the JasiR teRhfiTVes afO theBreNs BG afaASsis are HresefteO if sVRh a CaS that the iftiNate RBffeRtiBfs JetCeef its LariBVs JrafRhes are strBfYAS eNHhasiPeO the traOitiBfaAeS seHarate sVJWeRts BG reaA afaASsis afO RBNHAeE afaASsis are thVs VfiteO sBNe BG the JasiR iOeas GrBN GVfRtiBfaA afaASsis are aAsB ifRAVOeO

Girst Sear looks a lot like First Year.
G = f
S = y

this JBBM RBntains a first year YraOVate RBVrse in ChiRh the JasiR teRhniTVes anO theBreNs Bf anaAysis are HresenteO in sVRh a Cay that the intiNate RBnneRtiBns JetCeen its LariBVs JranRhes are strBnYAy eNHhasiPeO the traOitiBnaAey seHarate sVJWeRts Bf reaA anaAysis anO RBNHAeE anaAysis are thVs VniteO sBNe Bf the JasiR iOeas frBN fVnRtiBnaA anaAysis are aAsB inRAVOeO

BB can be oo, and RB looks like contains.
B = o
R = c

this JooM contains a first year YraOVate coVrse in Chich the Jasic techniTVes anO theoreNs of anaAysis are HresenteO in sVch a Cay that the intiNate connections JetCeen its LarioVs Jranches are stronYAy eNHhasiPeO the traOitionaAey seHarate sVJWects of reaA anaAysis anO coNHAeE anaAysis are thVs VniteO soNe of the Jasic iOeas froN fVnctionaA anaAysis are aAso incAVOeO

coVrse is very probable to be course with the first year subject. 

Jasic looks like basic.

Assuming:
J = b
V = u

this booM contains a first year YraOuate course in Chich the basic techniTues anO theoreNs of anaAysis are HresenteO in such a Cay that the intiNate connections betCeen its Larious branches are stronYAy eNHhasiPeO the traOitionaAey seHarate subWects of reaA anaAysis anO coNHAeE anaAysis are thus uniteO soNe of the basic iOeas froN functionaA anaAysis are aAso incAuOeO

booM looks like book. YraQuate looks like graduate. Chich looks like which.

Going to try all of these.

M = k
O = d
Y = g
C = w

this book contains a first year graduate course in which the basic techniTues and theoreNs of anaAysis are Hresented in such a way that the intiNate connections between its Larious branches are strongAy eNHhasiPed the traditionaAey seHarate subWects of reaA anaAysis and coNHAeE anaAysis are thus united soNe of the basic ideas froN functionaA anaAysis are aAso incAuded

This looks pretty solvable now, but just to be sure.

techniTues is likely techniques
anaAysis is likely analysis
reaA is likely real
functionaA is likely functional 
soNe is likely some
subWects is likely subjects

Assume:
T = q
A = l
N = m
W = j

this book contains a first year graduate course in which the basic techniques and theorems of analysis are Hresented in such a way that the intimate connections between its Larious branches are strongly emHhasiPed the traditionaley seHarate subjects of real analysis and comHleE analysis are thus united some of the basic ideas from functional analysis are also included

Hresented is likely presented.
emHhasiPed is likely emphasized
seHarate is likely separate

this book contains a first year graduate course in which the basic techniques and theorems of analysis are presented in such a way that the intimate connections between its Larious branches are strongly emphasized the traditionaley separate subjects of real analysis and compleE analysis are thus united some of the basic ideas from functional analysis are also included

compleE is complex and Larious is Various


**Final answer:**
this book contains a first year graduate course in which the basic techniques and theorems of analysis are presented in such a way that the intimate connections between its various branches are strongly emphasized the traditionaley separate subjects of real analysis and complex analysis are thus united some of the basic ideas from functional analysis are also included
