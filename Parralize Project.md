Building a distributed computing application in Rust for processing large amounts of text on multiple machines over a LAN is a great project. Given that you're using NixOS, the consistency in environment across the systems will help in reducing deployment issues. I'll break down the key components you'll need, as well as some tools and libraries that may be useful for you:

### 1. **Distributed Task Management**

You'll need a way to manage tasks across the machines and distribute work among them. This will involve:

- **Task scheduling**: You need to split the text into manageable chunks (for example, by lines or paragraphs) and assign these chunks to the available workers (machines).
- **Load balancing**: A way to dynamically allocate tasks to workers that are idle or less loaded.

**Rust tools for this**:

- **Tokio** or **async-std** for asynchronous task management. These are Rust libraries for handling asynchronous workloads efficiently. You can manage the scheduling of tasks using these libraries and make sure that tasks are distributed in a non-blocking manner.
- **Rayon**: This library simplifies parallelism by handling concurrent computation over a collection of data. It's designed for multi-core parallelism, but you can extend it for multi-machine distributed computing by using networked communication.

**NixOS tools for distributed task management**:

- **NixOps**: This is a deployment tool for NixOS that can be used to manage configurations for distributed systems. It will help you define and deploy your app across multiple machines.
- **NixOS services**: You can define custom NixOS services that communicate between your nodes. These services can handle task dispatching, execution, and reporting.

### 2. **Network Communication between Nodes**

You need a reliable way to communicate between the machines. This is especially important for sending tasks, receiving results, and managing system states.

**Rust tools for communication**:

- **gRPC** (via `tonic` crate): gRPC is a powerful RPC framework that works well for distributed systems. With `tonic`, you can define your service methods (such as `parse_text`) and use gRPC to handle communication between the nodes.
- **Message Brokers**: Use a message queue like **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** for reliable communication between nodes. The `lapin` crate is a popular Rust client for RabbitMQ. These message brokers can help manage the communication in a decoupled manner, allowing nodes to pick up tasks asynchronously.
- **WebSockets or TCP**: For low-level communication, you can use WebSockets (`tokio-tungstenite` crate) or TCP connections (`tokio` or `async-std` crates) to handle messaging between nodes directly.

### 3. **Distributed State Management and Coordination**

You will need to track the state of the distributed system, ensuring that each node knows which tasks it has processed and which ones remain. This includes:

- **Task status tracking**: Nodes must know if a task has been completed or if it's still being processed.
- **Global coordination**: If you want nodes to synchronize tasks, you can use a centralized state store (like Redis) or implement consensus protocols (such as **Raft**).

**Rust tools for coordination**:

- **Redis**: You can use Redis as a shared in-memory data structure store to handle coordination and tracking. The `redis` crate allows you to interact with Redis from Rust. This can be useful for managing task queues, tracking progress, or even storing partial results.
- **Zookeeper or etcd**: These are tools for distributed coordination, allowing you to manage the state of distributed systems. Rust has bindings for these libraries, and they can be used for leader election, locking, and storing configuration data.

### 4. **Parallel Text Processing Logic**

For splitting the large text into chunks and processing it concurrently, you’ll need:

- **Text Parsing**: The algorithm or logic that splits and processes the text.
- **Worker Nodes**: Each worker will parse a subset of the text in parallel.

**Rust tools for parallel text processing**:

- **Serde**: You can use the `serde` crate for serializing and deserializing data, such as JSON, which might be helpful for sending structured data between workers.
- **Rayon**: Again, for parallelism, Rayon simplifies splitting the work across cores. For distributed systems, you can extend this idea using distributed computation frameworks or task queues, as mentioned earlier.
- **Swarms**: If you want to manage distributed computations, you can look into "swarm" frameworks like **Xid** for coordination of tasks in a distributed system. This could help define each worker's chunk of the text.

### 5. **Monitoring and Debugging**

Monitoring and debugging in a distributed system is essential. You'll need tools to track the health of the system, as well as logs and metrics from each node.

**Rust tools for monitoring**:

- **Prometheus**: Use the `prometheus` crate to expose metrics about the nodes (CPU usage, task completion rates, error rates, etc.).
- **Distributed Logging**: Tools like **log4rs** or **slog** can help with structured logging on each node, and you can aggregate logs centrally using a log management system like **ELK** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

**NixOS tools for monitoring**:

- **NixOS Prometheus module**: This can integrate Prometheus directly into your NixOS configuration to expose metrics about your nodes and system performance.
- **Grafana**: Once you have Prometheus set up, Grafana can visualize the system’s metrics, giving you insights into task processing and system health.

### 6. **Fault Tolerance and Recovery**

Your distributed system must be fault-tolerant, especially when working with multiple nodes. This means:

- **Task retries**: If a node fails to process a task, it should be retried or transferred to another node.
- **Data redundancy**: Ensure that text chunks are replicated or can be recomputed if necessary.

**Rust tools for fault tolerance**:

- **Tokio** and **async-std** both support retry mechanisms (e.g., using `tokio-retry`).
- **Resilience patterns**: Implement retries, exponential backoffs, and circuit breakers manually, or use existing libraries like **retry** to handle transient failures.

### High-Level Architecture Breakdown

1. **Master Node**: Acts as a scheduler and coordinator, deciding how to split the text and assigning tasks to worker nodes. It also keeps track of task progress.
2. **Worker Nodes**: Each node processes a chunk of the text. When completed, it reports back to the master node.
3. **Task Queue**: A message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) or shared state (e.g., Redis) that stores and distributes tasks.
4. **Communication Layer**: gRPC or TCP connections for reliable communication between the master node and worker nodes.
5. **Fault Tolerance**: A task will be reassigned if a node fails, and any intermediate state is stored in Redis or a similar store.
6. **Metrics and Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, or any other tool to monitor the health of the system.

### Conclusion

To summarize, you’ll likely use a combination of these components:

- **Rust libraries**: `tokio`, `rayon`, `tonic`, `redis`, `serde`
- **NixOS tools**: NixOps for deployment, Prometheus for monitoring
- **Communication**: gRPC or message brokers (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- **Fault tolerance**: Redis, retry mechanisms, and failure detection

This should provide a solid foundation for building a distributed text-parsing application in Rust. Let me know if you'd like further details on any part of the architecture!
