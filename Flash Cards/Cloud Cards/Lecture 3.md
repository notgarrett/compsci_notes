What are common types of cloud service usage conditions defined in a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)?  
?  
Uptime, security characteristics, quality of service (QoS), availability, reliability, and performance.

Why does cloud computing introduce increased security vulnerabilities?  
?  
Sharing data with a cloud provider increases exposure, offering more opportunities for malicious users to attack IT resources and compromise data.

What is a Service-Level Agreement (SLA) in cloud computing?  
?  
An SLA is the human-readable part of a service contract that outlines usage conditions, including uptime, security, QoS, availability, reliability, and performance.

What is the primary challenge in ensuring portability between cloud providers?  
?  
Lack of established industry standards, leading to proprietary public cloud technologies that complicate migration.

What is the role of a cloud resource administrator?  
?  
The cloud resource administrator manages cloud-based IT resources and may belong to either the cloud consumer or cloud provider organization.

What is the difference between an organizational boundary and a trust boundary?  
?  
An organizational boundary surrounds IT resources owned by an organization, while a trust boundary extends to cloud environments trusted by the organization.

What are the six common characteristics of cloud computing?  
?  
On-demand usage, ubiquitous access, multi-tenancy (and resource pooling), elasticity, measured usage, and resiliency.

What is multi-tenancy in cloud computing?  
?  
Multi-tenancy allows a single instance of an IT resource to serve multiple consumers while maintaining isolation among them.

How does resiliency in cloud computing ensure reliability?  
?  
Resiliency uses redundant implementations of IT resources across different physical locations to provide failover in case of failure.

What is the benefit of elasticity in a cloud environment?  
?  
Elasticity enables automatic scaling of IT resources in response to runtime conditions or predefined configurations, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
