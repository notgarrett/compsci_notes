What is the distinction between a cloud and the traditional Internet?  
?  
A cloud provides scalable and measured IT resources, focusing on processing/computing capabilities, whereas the traditional Internet delivers content-based IT resources via the Web.

What does the term "on-premise" refer to in cloud computing?  
?  
"On-premise" refers to IT resources hosted within an organization's own controlled environment, not based in the cloud.

What are the two main types of scaling in cloud computing?  
?  
Horizontal scaling (scaling out/in, more machines) and vertical scaling (scaling up/down, upgrades).

?  
Horizontal scaling adds or removes identical IT resources, while vertical scaling replaces an IT resource with another of higher or lower capacity.

What is a cloud service?

?  
The cloud provider offers cloud-based IT resources, and the cloud consumer uses these resources.

What are the three key benefits of adopting cloud computing?  
?  
Reduced investments and proportional costs, increased scalability, and increased availability and reliability.

What is the primary economic rationale for investing in cloud-based IT resources?  
?  
The reduction of up-front investments, such as hardware and software costs, through a pay-as-you-go model.

How does a cloud increase availability and reliability?  
?  
Cloud providers offer resilient IT resources with failover support, modular architecture, and guarantees of high availability.

What are common types of cloud service usage conditions defined in a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)?  
?  
Uptime, security characteristics, quality of service (QoS), availability, reliability, and performance.
