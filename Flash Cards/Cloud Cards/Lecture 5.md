What is Amazon EC2?
?
**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that offers resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to simplify the process of scaling and managing virtual servers for various applications.

With Amazon EC2, users can:
- Launch virtual servers (instances) with customizable operating systems and configurations.
- Scale capacity up or down based on demand.
- Pay only for the compute resources used (pay-as-you-go model).
- Leverage high availability, security, and integration with other AWS services.
