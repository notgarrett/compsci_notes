**PaaS (Platform as a Service)** is a cloud computing service model that provides a platform for developers to build, test, deploy, and manage applications without the complexity of managing underlying infrastructure.
It includes pre-configured resources like development tools, runtime environments, databases, and operating systems, enabling developers to focus on application development while the cloud provider handles hardware, software updates, storage, and scaling.
