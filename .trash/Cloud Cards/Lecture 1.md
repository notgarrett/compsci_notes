>[!question] 
>What are the three primary cloud service models discussed in the course? 
?
>>[!answer] Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

>[!question]
>What are the four cloud deployment models covered in this course?
?
>>[!answer]
>>Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and Community Cloud.


>[!question]
What is the definition of cloud computing according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)?
?
>>[!answer]
>>Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

>[!question]
What are the three primary business drivers of cloud computing?
?
>>[!answer]
>>Capacity Planning, Cost Reduction, and Organizational Agility.

>[!question]  
>What is capacity planning in the context of IT >resources, and what are its goals?  
?
>>[!answer]  
>>Capacity planning involves determining and fulfilling future demands for IT resources, products, and services. Its goals are to minimize inefficiencies from over-provisioning and avoid under-provisioning that fails to meet user needs, balancing demand and capacity effectively.

>[!question]
What are some pre-existing technologies that influenced cloud computing?
?
>>[!answer]
>>Clustering, Grid Computing, and Virtualization.

>[!question]
What is the role of virtualization in cloud computing?
?
>>[!answer]
>>Virtualization enables the creation of virtual instances of IT resources, allowing physical resources to provide multiple virtual images shared by multiple users.

>[!question]
How does grid computing differ from clustering?
?
>>[!answer]
>>Grid computing involves loosely coupled, geographically dispersed resources organized into pools, while clustering uses tightly integrated resources with redundancy and failover features.

>[!question]
What are the six common characteristics of cloud computing platforms?
?
>>[!answer]
>>Scalability, dynamic provisioning, flexible platforms, reliance on virtualization, a new paradigm for collective computing, and cost reduction in mega data centers.

>[!question]
What are the key factors contributing to the adoption of cloud computing?
?
>>[!answer]
>>Broadband ubiquity, falling storage costs, Internet software improvements, and converging technologies like virtualization and service-oriented architecture.
