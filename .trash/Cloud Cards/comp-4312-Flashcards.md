>[!question]
>What does the following diagram describe?
>![[Pasted image 20241126141440.png]]
?
>>[!answer]
>>Step 1: "up-time": The SLA monitor polls the cloud service sending polling request messages $M_{REQ_{1}}$ to $M_{REQ_{N}}$; and receives the respective polling response messages $M_{REP_{1}}$ to $M_{REP_{N}}$ reporting that the service is 'up' at each polling cycle (1a). The SLA monitor stores the 'up' time period (time it takes to poll cycles 1 to N) in the log database (1b).
>>
>>Step 2: "down-time": The SLA monitor polls the cloud service sending polling request messages $M_{REQ_{N+1}}$ to $M_{REQ_{N+M}}$ and polling response messages are not received (2a). While the response messages keep timing out, the SLA monitor stores the 'down' time period (time it takes the poll cycles N+1 to N+M) in the log database (2b).
