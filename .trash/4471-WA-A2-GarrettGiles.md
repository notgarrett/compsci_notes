# Note!!

I did this on Wayland on linux, and the distribution was NixOS. With this distribution, the path to the opencv path is <opencv4/opencv2/...>

I believe to get any of this working on other computers, you just need to update the include path to be <opencv2/...>

However below is proof I have working code.

To run my code, simply run the shell file (or the contents in it) using gcc. If you are using visual studio, the run button should suffice.
