**Our checklist is here**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbuACGvQvjgXgxGNiO89ni5uO4Lj-jJK1cUKPT1EzJM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.sp9zv3h39105


**Step 1: Review Your Assigned Language and Locale üì¶**

- **Language:** You‚Äôll be given a specific language and locale.
- **Purpose:** We are teaching the model to answer math questions in a variety of languages so that it can perform well all over the world!¬†
- **Why This Matters**: Covering many topics makes the AI useful for people with different needs and interests. Your careful work here helps make the model more versatile!

  

**Step 2: Write a Prompt ‚úçÔ∏è**

- **What is a Prompt?:** A prompt is a math question or reasoning problem that you write. It tells the AI what to talk about and how to respond.
- **Key Point:** Your prompt is the foundation of this task.

  

**Step 3: Review Two AI Responses and Complete Two Jobs üîç**

Now, the AI will respond to your prompt twice. You‚Äôll review both responses carefully. You have two main tasks:

1. **Math-Checking:**

- **Did the model provide the correct final answer?** Test whether the response provided the correct final answer.
- **Did the model write out any incorrect steps or make incorrect reasoning steps?** Once the model generates a response to your prompt, review it carefully. Identify areas where the response falls short or makes mistakes. If one of the models does not have an issue, edit your prompt and try again until you make the model fail

2. **Proofreading:**

- Think of yourself as the **‚Äúlanguage expert.‚Äù**
- Check for any unnatural language, awkward phrasing, or grammar errors in your language.
- The AI might not speak your language perfectly, so look out for things that sound odd or don‚Äôt flow well.
- **Did it follow instructions correctly?** Check that the AI stayed within the constraints and didn‚Äôt make mistakes.
- **Is the information accurate?** The AI sometimes gets facts wrong, so make sure everything is true and correct.

  

**Step 4: Rate the Responses üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è**

After proofreading and fact-checking, you will rate each response based on how well it performed. Here‚Äôs what to keep in mind:

- **Provide a Justification:** Your explanation helps the AI understand what it did wrong.
- **Side-by-Side Rating:** If asked, compare both responses and select the better one. Explain why the chosen response is stronger or more accurate. A high-quality explanation helps improve the model.

  

**Step 5: Improve the Selected Response üé®**

Finally, if the selected response has errors, you will have to edit to make it better. Here‚Äôs what to do:

- **Fix math errors:**¬† correct the incorrect step(s) clearly and concisely. The rewrite should be self-contained and understandable, following a logical sequence of reasoning.¬†
- **Correct Language Errors:** Fix any grammar mistakes, spelling errors, or any fluency issues.
- **Follow Instructions Precisely:** Ensure that the AI‚Äôs response matches all instructions perfectly.
- **All Claims are Accurate: Make sure everything the model says is true and accurate.**

Following these steps carefully will make a real difference in improving AI quality. Your attention to detail, accuracy, and fluency help create a model that is more helpful for everyone!¬†

This instructions document will explain every step above in detail to make sure your tasks are high quality!

**üß† Concept: What is a user prompt?**

A user prompt is a math question or reasoning problem that guides the AI on what to say and how to say it. A good prompt has three elements:

**Clear about what the response is asking for:**
- What it is: The background or main topic that tells the model what the response should answer.
- The prompt must be clear about what needs to be solved. You must ask the model something that another human would also be able to understand.
 
    
**Solvable:**
- Avoid problems that don't contain the information necessary to solve them.
- Avoid problems with impossible scenarios, for example:
- Dividing by zero
- Asking for the square root of a negative number if the domain is real numbers
- Avoid problems containing terms, concepts, theorems, or lemmas that do not adhere to mathematical rules


**One correct solution:**
- Avoid problems that have many potential answers. We want problems where the answer is well-defined and uniquely exists.

**üß† Concept: Rating**

The rating aspect is simply marking which items the response ‚Äúchecks off‚Äù. This is the simplest part of the task, but one that needs the closest attention to detail.¬†

Your rating will be linked to the proofreading and fact-checking we discussed in the previous section. You will do two types of rating:

1. **Dimension Ratings**
2. Each response will be individually rated on:
3. Fluency & Localization
4. Instruction Following
5. Truthfulness¬†
6. Writing Style and Clarity
7. Verbosity

  

1. **Side-by-side Rating**
2. You will select the better response and justify why

Any task that doesn‚Äôt perform correct ratings risks a low quality score, so please do not rush through this section!

**üîé Dimension Ratings**

Once you‚Äôve identified that **one of the responses has errors**, you will need to **rate both responses** on a scale of **1-3** for each criterion, with **3 being the highest score**. Here are the categories to focus on:

- **Instruction Following**
- **Implicit Instructions**: Does the response address implied instructions from the prompt?
- **Explicit Instructions**: Does the response follow directly stated requirements in the prompt?
- **Overall Adherence**: Does the response meet all the requirements both implicit and explicit?
-

**Localization**
- **Cultural Nuances**: Does the response reflect cultural norms and sensitivities of the prompt's context?
- **Language Adaptation**: Is the response adapted appropriately to the language used in the prompt?

    
**Truthfulness**
- **Claim Accuracy**: Are all claims and details in the response factually correct?
- **Logical Steps**: Are reasoning steps valid and error-free?

    
**Verbosity**
- **Optimal Length**: Is the response neither too terse nor overly verbose?
- **Efficiency**: Does the solution optimize the number of steps while being complete?

    
- **Style and Clarity**
- **Readability**: Is the response easy to read and understand?
- **Structure**: Is the response well-structured and visually organized?
- **Formatting**: Does the response use appropriate formatting tools like lists or markdown to enhance clarity?

  

**‚öñÔ∏è Side by Side Rating**

**Selecting the Better Response**

After reading both responses, you‚Äôll choose which one is better using the following options:

1. **Response A is much better:** Choose this if Response A is significantly better, or if Response B has major issues (e.g., wrong language, gibberish, incomplete).
2. **Response A is better**: Choose this if Response A performs better in most rating criteria, especially the key ones like accuracy, completeness, and fluency.
3. **Response A is slightly better:** Choose this if Response A is only a little better in one or two criteria.
4. **Tie:** Choose this if both responses are of similar quality across all dimensions or have individual strengths that balance out.

The same options apply for Response B if it‚Äôs better.

  

**Writing a Justification for Your Choice**

Your justification explains why you chose one response over the other. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

1. Stick to the Evidence: Focus on the main differences between the two responses. No need to mention criteria that don‚Äôt have issues.
2. Focus on Key Criteria: Only discuss the dimensions that affected your choice (e.g., if Truthfulness was a big difference, mention that).
3. Be Concise: Avoid flowery language or extra details that aren‚Äôt needed.
4. Depth and Completeness Matter: It‚Äôs better to focus on the quality and accuracy of information over writing style or formatting.
5. Don‚Äôt Use LLMs: Write your justification independently.

After you complete selecting the preferred response and give a justification for your preference score, you will be asked to answer a few questions. These questions will determine if a writing¬†step is needed.

Unless the response you selected is perfect and has no issues at all, **you are expected to fix and improve the selected response so that it doesn‚Äôt have any math or language issues**. A perfect response should be accurate and fully aligned with the prompt‚Äôs requests and constraints. Fixing a response is composed of three major steps.

  
**Step 1: Truthfulness üéØ**

1. **Review claims, math steps, and reasoning**: The response should be mathematically correct and reasoning based on information in the prompt or appropriate mathematical properties/theorem. If there are any errors in the original response, they should be corrected in your perfect response.
2. **How to Rewrite**:¬†
3. If the original response had incorrect information, rewrite it with the correct information embedded naturally.
4. **Maintain Sequential Integrity**: Ensure that your rewrite preserves the logical order of the original reasoning and includes the same level of detail.
5. **Clarity in Rewriting:** Rewrite the step clearly and concisely, using simple language that avoids jargon. The rewrite should be self-contained and understandable, following a logical sequence of reasoning.
6. **Focus on Problem-Solving:** Only include information necessary to solve the problem. Do not add extraneous details like definitions of basic concepts.
7. **What to Look For**: Check that all the facts presented are correct.

  

**Step 2: Instruction Following üìè**

- **Compare to the Prompt**: The perfect response should exactly follow the instructions provided in the prompt. This includes adhering to any constraints like format, length, structure, or content requirements.
- **How to Rewrite**: If the initial response deviates from the instructions (e.g., exceeds word count or fails to meet the format), revise it to strictly follow the original guidelines.

  

**Step 3: Improve the response‚Äôs fluency and style üí¨**

- Think of yourself as the ‚Äúlanguage expert.‚Äù
- Check for any unnatural language, awkward phrasing, or grammar errors in your language.
- The AI might not speak your language perfectly, so look out for things that sound odd or don‚Äôt flow well.
- Ensure that the model use the tone specified in the prompt and the the tone is respectulf of cultural context
- The response should not have **any awkward phrasing or language errors EVER!**

**4. LaTeX and Formatting Problems**

**5. Language and Instruction Following Errors**

**6. Conceptual Errors**

**Key Takeaways**

  
- Math errors make up quite a few issues, so let's make sure we **double-check our math across the board.**
- Ambiguous or misleading problem statements **cause confusion.** Specify the conditions for your solution do not assume, write it down in your prompt.
- **Truthfulness ratings are often incorrect** due to overlooked errors, if the mistake is not caught our ratings are off too. Check your math to avoid this.
- Formatting and LaTeX issues make some responses unreadable.
- Language and instruction-following errors **contribute to unnecessary** mistakes. We do not have to be math experts to avoid this one we just need to be careful!
