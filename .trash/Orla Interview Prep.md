	    - DHCP (dynamic host config protocol) is a protocol that gives local devices on a wifi connection unique IPs
	    - VPNs is a virtual private network, creates a secure, encrypted connection between a device and a remote network, typically over the internet==
        
    - VoIP and telephony systems (e.g., Cisco, Mitel)
	    - Using the internet to make a phone call instead of a regular phone line or analog signal
        
    - Server room/data center experience is a plus

## üí¨ Interview Questions You Might Be Asked

### Technical

- How do you troubleshoot a user‚Äôs inability to access a network printer?
	- Come up with step by step instructions to give the user to get it working.
	- If that fails, go to the printer in person.
    
- Walk me through resolving a BSOD (blue screen of death).
	- Google search reasons for the BSOD, likely having to do some sort of factory reset, or work in the bios.
    
- How would you handle a ticket where a site-wide system outage is reported?
	- This depends on where I am positioned, as an analyst I would contact higher up IT services/peers to get any surface level information about why and how long it will take to solve (assuming I cannot help) and give that information to the one who posted the ticket.
    

### Behavioral

- Describe a time you had to manage multiple support tickets under pressure.
    
- How do you ensure clear communication with non-technical staff in high-stress situations?
    
- Tell me about a time you introduced an improvement to a support process.
    

### Situational

- You receive a request from a mine supervisor while already working on a critical issue‚Äîwhat do you do?
    
- What steps would you take if you discovered an unreported security vulnerability?
