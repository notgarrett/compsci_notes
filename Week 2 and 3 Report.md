Job content and accomplishment:
Implementing connections to the twitter (X) application. 

My role has been implementing a connection to twitter, in which we have the user login (via the twitter platform) and then store the returning credentials in our database. With these credentials saved and linked to the original user, I have also added the functionality in which the user can post on twitter. This involves the user filling out a form which contains and image and text, then the user is able to click a post button and it posts this to the user's account. The functionality to disconnect from twitter has also been implemented on my part.
