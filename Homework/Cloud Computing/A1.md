# Q1

## A)
A year has 8760 hours.

$$A = \frac{17520}{17520 + 24} = .9986$$

Max downtime:

$$\frac{(1-0.98)\times{8760}}{12} = 14.6$$

14.6 hours per month.

Random failure rate: 
$$\frac{(1-0.9986)\times{8760}}{12} \approx 1$$

1 Hour per month.

$$RMT = 14.6 - 1 \approx 13.6$$

13.6 hours per month. 

## B)

**Cumulative Distribution Function**
$$A = \sum\limits_{i=k}^{3}\begin{pmatrix}3 \\ i\end{pmatrix}p^{i}(1-p)^{3-i}$$

## C)
$$\begin{align*}
k &= 1\\
A &= \sum\limits^{3}_{i=1}\begin{pmatrix}3\\
i\end{pmatrix}p^{i}(1-p)^{3-i}\\
&= (3 \times 0.98 \times 0.02^{2})+(3 \times 0.98^{2}\times0.98^{3})\\
&= 0.999992
\end{align*}$$

$$\begin{align*}
k &= 2\\
A &= \sum\limits^{3}_{i=2}\begin{pmatrix}3\\
i\end{pmatrix}p^{i}(1-p)^{3-i}\\
&= (3 \times 0.98^{2} \times 0.02^{2})+(0.98^{3})\\
&= 0.9988
\end{align*}$$

$$\begin{align*}
k &= 3\\
A &= \sum\limits^{3}_{i=1}\begin{pmatrix}3\\
i\end{pmatrix}p^{i}(1-p)^{3-i}\\
&= 0.98^{3}\\
&= 0.9411  <0.96
\end{align*}$$

Thus the largest minimum number of servers is 2.

# Q2

## A)

Core A: $\frac{64}{1}=64$

Core B: $\frac{64}{2}=32$

Core C: $\frac{64}{3}$

Core D: $\frac{64}{1}=64$

Total execution time is **64** units. 

## B)

All cores utilised for $\frac{64}{3}$ units.
Our total time is 64 units.

$$URate = \frac{\frac{64}{3}}{64} \approx 3.33\%$$
