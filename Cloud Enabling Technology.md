# Cloud Enabling Technology

Modern day clouds are under pinned by a set of primary technology components that collectively enable key features and characteristics associated with contemporary cloud computing.

These include:
- Broadband Networks and Internet Architecture
- Web Technology
- Data Centre Technology
- Virtualisation Technology
- Multi-tenant Technology
- Service Technology

# Broadband Networks and Internet Architecture

Established and deployed by ISPs (Internet Service Provider), the Internet's largest backbone networks are strategically interconnected by core routers that connect the world's multinational reworks.

ISPs can freely deploy, operate, and manage their networks. Additionally they also select partner ISPs for interconnection.

No centralised entity comprehensively governs the internet, although bodies like *Internet Corperation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)* supervise and coordinate internet communication.

The internet's topology has become a dynamic and complex aggregate of ISPs that are highly interconnected via its core protocols.

Smaller branches extend from these major nodes of interconnection, branching outwards through smaller networks until eventually reaching every internet enabled electronic device.

The core Tier 1 is made of large-scale, international service providers that oversee massive interconnected global networks, which are connected to Tier 2's large regional providers.

The interconnected ISPs of Tier 2 connect with Tier 1 providers, as well as the local ISPs of Tier 3.

Cloud consumers and cloud providers can connect directly using a Tier 1 provider.

## Packet Switching

**End-to-end** data flows are divided into packets of a limited size that are received and processed through network switches and routers, then queued and forwarded from one intermediary node to the next.

Each packet carries the necessary location information, such as the IP or MAC address, to be processed and routed at every source intermediary, and destination node.
